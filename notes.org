* TODO TIC TAC TOE game
The exercise involves developing a Tic-Tac-Toe game strictly adhering to the TDD rules.
** DONE 1 â€“ Game Board Creation phase
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2021-03-29 Mon 16:59]
*** DONE describe board
    - State "DONE"       from "IN-PROGRESS" [2021-03-29 Mon 16:59]
    - State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"       [2021-03-29 Mon 16:46]
** TODO describe winning scenarios
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2021-03-29 Mon 17:01]--[2021-03-29 Mon 17:04] =>  0:03
   :END:
*** TODO horizontal line winner
** TODO describe board operations
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2021-03-29 Mon 17:04]--[2021-03-29 Mon 17:11] =>  0:07

* Tech debt
- define function is-empty to test for board cell emptines
- we most probably do not need board offset (examine and refactor)
- extract board offset  calculation
